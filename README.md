- The full notebooks have been converted to Python/PyMC 5 by Dustin Stanbury and are available [here](https://github.com/dustinstansbury/statistical-rethinking-2023.git)
- This repository is a consolidation of the notebooks from the above two sources, with some additional notes and exercises.
- The slides for the accompanying lectures are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MHiFRP7CpvTygIHxfQ_qA4oIt98_8g6kQjJSC6lu1Y8/edit?usp=sharing)
